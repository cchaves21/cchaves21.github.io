- Tight deadlines and regulatory requirements from the Central Bank
- Complex integrations with existing banking infrastructure

**My Contributions:**
- Conducted the **test strategy** for the mobile core payment modules
- Implemented **automated regression testing** for Back-end using Java with Rest Assured
- I acted as a **focal point** between multiple squads, ensuring adequate communication between engineers and stakeholders.
- Coordinated with cross-functional teams to ensure **compliance and stability**

**Impact:**

## <a name="epos-now"></a>ðŸ§­ Epos Now â€“ Building a Culture of Quality

At Epos Now sence 2022, a leading provider of POS systems in the UK, I joined as a **Senior QA Engineer** and was later promoted to **Head of QA**. During this period, the company experienced significant growth, scaling its annual revenue to over $150 million.

**Challenges:**
- The challenge with legacy code, with only E2E tests with a regression suite with more than 800 TC
- Manual testing bottlenecks impacting release cycles and reliability
- Opportunity for improvement with a team of 1 QA for every 8 devs
- A fragmented team with unclear quality ownership

**My Contributions:**
- Picked the start and rolled out a **QA Handbook** to standardize practices across squads
- Introduced **test automation** with Playwright across the lagacy migration projects
- Developed a strategy based on the **Test Pyramid**, balancing unit, integration, and E2E tests
- I championed a **shift-left** testing strategy by leading workshops that showcased its impact through data-driven results and achieving greater test coverage and quality without growing the QA team.
- Mentored junior and middle QAs and initiated a **Path to Engineering** program, helping support agents transition into QA roles
- Integrated tests into **CI/CD pipelines** using GitLab CI and Jenkins

**Impact:**
- Reduced production bugs by 40%
- Improved deployment frequency and confidence with 2 full automated projects
- Fostered a strong **quality culture** with cross-team accountability
- Reduces project bottlenecks during the testing phase, allowing for more deliveries
