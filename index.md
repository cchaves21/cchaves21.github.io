## About Me

I'm Carlos Chaves, a QA professional with over 15 years of experience in software quality, automation, and technical leadership. I started my journey in São Paulo, Brazil, working at a consultancy focused on integrated business solutions. What began as an internship quickly turned into a lifelong passion for testing and quality engineering.

Over the years, I've worked across multiple industries, from finance to retail tech. Always with a focus on improving product quality and team maturity through smart processes and tooling.

Currently, I serve as **Head of QA** in a British company that has scaled revenue to $150M+ in the last year, where I lead strategic quality initiatives and support the growth of QA as an engineering discipline.
